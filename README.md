# MANUAL-SQL-EN-R

This is a material that can be used little by little
to use SQL within R. First, it is 
necessary to add the definitions of what SQL is and the functions 
that can be used to connect databases, create tables, join, manipulate, 
iterate and extract queries. Once this is understood, from R and
Python generate the codes that can be used to 
extract queries that are too heavy and are saved 
through files with a .csv extension.

This will serve in the future for jobs where programming 
languages are used to make it 
easier to iterate the forms and 
extensions of large queries.
